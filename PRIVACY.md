# Privacy Policy – Sundial

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

## Data Collection

Sundial does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data Storage

Your saved locations and preferences (12H/24H format) are stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data syncs across your Chrome browsers via your Google account — Sundial has no access to your Google account and does not operate any servers.

## Third-Party Services

Sundial uses the [Open-Meteo Geocoding API](https://open-meteo.com/) to search for cities worldwide. These requests contain only the city name you type — no personal information is sent.

## Permissions
